# TabCleaner
TabCleaner is a Chrome extension that simplifies the new tab page and adds customization options.  Now with more Material Design!

Optionally remove the Google Plus links, Google logo, redundant search bar, and recently visited pages from Chrome's new tab page.
Add a custom background or change opacity of the recently visited pages area.

In the case of the tutorial cards somehow being closed before they were read, mouseover the bottom right hand corner of the new tab page to see the TabCleaner's settings button.
